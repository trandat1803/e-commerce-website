<h1>Chapter I: INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2>I.1. Motivation</h2>
<p text-align: justify>Currently, the quantity and quality of goods serving people's needs is increasing day by day. Along with that is the growth of customer demand. We have also found that having a website for business generates more revenue than with a traditional business model. Simply, we can see that a website brings great benefits in terms of profits through advertising, reaching customers from anywhere. Customers can choose products more proactively. Thereby, we can also interact with customers, record their reviews of the product to improve. Because of the above ideas, we are planned to implement the website called: “HDH Sneaker store”.</p>
<h2>I.2. Problem Statement</h2>
<p text-align: justify>Since a long time, the footwear industry has flourished in Western countries, until recent years, this fashion industry has been imported to Vietnam and widely developed to young people in the region. Moreover, sellers also appear more and more distributors in Vietnam. In which, the two most famous sports shoes lines in this industry belong to Adidas and Nike, which are also two companies that receive huge profits from Vietnamese customers.
The implementation of a sales website also brings a lot of difficulties partly because of the competition among dozens of other selling websites, partly because of the problem of ensuring the quality of a website.
It was possible for the team to develop this website because we saw the potential in sportswear. At the same time, it is a solution for students to have an additional source of income by the seller feature, which also increases the income source for the development team.</p>
